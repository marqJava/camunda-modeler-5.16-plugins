# BPMN ColorPicker Plugin

## A very simple Color Picker as a plugin for the Camunda Modeler.

### This plugin has moved to a new home in the [Camunda Community Hub](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-modeler-plugin-color-picker) and its name has been updated to reflect our [journey from Camunda BPM to Camunda Platform](https://camunda.com/blog/2021/04/the-journey-from-camunda-bpm-to-camunda-platform).

### Installation
Put this directory into the `plugins` directory of the Camunda Modeler and you're ready to go.

If you're interested in how to create your own plugins see the [documentation](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/tree/547-plugins/docs/plugins) and this [example](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler-plugin-example).
